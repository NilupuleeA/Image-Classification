IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2024 - Team Wavemasters
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for our participation in the IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2024. The competition challenges teams to address the problem of text-independent far-field speaker recognition under noise and reverberation conditions for mobile robots. Our team, Wavemasters, approached this challenge by leveraging signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to develop a robust speaker recognition system.
